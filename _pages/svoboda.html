If you were hoping for some original research, sadly I have none. 
What follows has already been written about elsewhere and by people far smarter than me. 
What I hope to bring to the conversation is a simplified version of their work and my 
story in discovering it. But more importantly, I hope to introduce you to some thoughts 
on adult language learning that fall outside the standard techniques of translation and 
grammar study.
